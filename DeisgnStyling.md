# Design Styling

This document defines the rules and formatting conventions for the entire project.

- Names of variables are in lower case. No pascal or camel cases.
- Word separation can be indicated by underscores ('\_'), but use of underscores is discouraged unless the name would be hard to read otherwise.
- Names of Modules, functions begin with a capital letter and word separation is shown with upper camel case instead of underscores.

Example,

### variables

`mysampledata = 10`
`samplejson = {...}`

### functions and Classes

`def callbacks: ....`
`def InvokeModels: ...`
`class CameraNode: ...`
