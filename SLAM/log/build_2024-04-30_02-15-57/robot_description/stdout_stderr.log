[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:12 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findgazebo_ros.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project
  has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "gazebo_ros", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "gazebo_ros" with
  any of the following names:

    gazebo_rosConfig.cmake
    gazebo_ros-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "gazebo_ros" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "gazebo_ros_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "gazebo_ros" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has
  been installed.
