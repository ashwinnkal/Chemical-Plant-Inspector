# Primer

This document as suggested _Primer_, is a go to doc for checking some important informations about the used packages, packet formats, project workflows, configurations, usernames, passcodes etc...

Just write down things that will help others for the actions you have created, sometimes reading others code is daunting especially when we are working within a shortframe.

> _Note: do not share any passkeys, confidential credentials or similar._
